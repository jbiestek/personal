# Personal

My name is Jeff Biestek and I'm currently a Product Analyst at Shipt. 

I believe in open communication and want this to serve as a snapshot of me for those who may interact with me regularly.  I hope you can learn about me through this documentation and learn how we can best work together!

• I love helping people so if there is something I can be helpful with please don't hesitate to ask.  I believe in direct communication so if you have questions ask them and I will do the same.  To that end, I would rather you ask me your specific question with an example of what you are doing right away then ask me if you can "ask me a question". 

• I am a morning person.  I've found myself most productive and successful coming in early to work and accomplish individual tasks and projects and leaving time in the afternoon to help assist and address questions others have for me.  In the early morning especially, I like to deeply concentrate on my tasks and interruptions and task switching can derail my productivity. 

• I live by my calendar.  My calendar should reflect all my meetings and have time blocked off for when I have set aside time for something.  If you have a question or want to meet with me, please go ahead and make a calendar invite and tell me what you wish to discuss in the details of the meeting.  

• Introvert vs Extrovert?: I used to think I was an introvert until I took a leadership course that reframed that question as "where do you get your energy".  I definitely thrive working with others and collaborating in team environments thus I now identify as an extrovert. 

• I love to learn new things especially understanding how things are built and how they function.  I learn best by doing things and seeing them come together.  

• I am task driven.  I work best when I have a list of to-dos and can work through them once I understand everything that is front of me.

• I need to get regular exercise to keep my brain fresh and function at my best.  If I seem stressed or short, tell me to go on a run.
